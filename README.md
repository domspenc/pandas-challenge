This repository showcases a python pandas analysis of local public and private schools, with a focus on school size, school budget, and average standardised test results.
</br>
It merges two .csv files; the first, a student-centric dataset featuring student ID, name, gender, year group, attending school, and test results for maths and reading; the second, a school-centric dataset featuring school ID, name, type, size and budget.

<h2>Observable Trends</h2>
</br>
<p>
Three observations that can be drawn from this analysis are as follows:
</br>
1. Looking at the top 5 and bottom 5 schools, according to '% Overall Passing', it is interesting to note that the highest performing school (Griffin High School) and lowest performing school (Hernandez High School) both have a similar per student budget, and yet student results are significantly different.
</br>
Perhaps, when looking at the 'Total Students' and 'Total School Budget' data for these schools, it is clear to see that there are 315% more students at Hernandez High School than Griffin High School.
Although both schools' budget per student is nearly on par, class sizes at Hernandez High School may be significantly larger, and therefore the quantity of student-teacher contact time, per student, is on average significantly less, resulting in lower test scores.
</br>
2. On this same thread, it is clear that the smaller the school (less than 1000 students), the higher the average test score.
</br>
When looking at the data school by school, in particular the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, the data seems to contradict itself. However, when looking at average test results categorised by school size, this observation becomes more clear.
</br>
This observations suggests that students in schools with a smaller student population have a more beneficial learning experience, have higher  quality contact time with teachers, have potentially less distractions, and therefore deliver better results than their peers attending schools with a larger student population.
</br>
3. When looking at the data categorised by School Type, test results on average are lower for Government schools, and higher for Independent schools.
</br>
Interestingly, the average budget per student for Government schools is higher than that for Independent schools.
